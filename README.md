# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repository contains the works of a Coursera.org's course, Getting and Cleaning Data. There are 4 files:
<ul>
  <li> README.md: contains the introduction and the purpose of this repository.</li>
  <li> CodeBook.md: contains the list of features and other important information of about the data set.</li>
  <li> run_analysis.R: the R script that performs the cleaning process according to the below tasks.</li>
  <li> tidy_data.txt: the cleaned and well-structured dataset, which is the output of this project.</li>
</ul>

The R script, run_analysis.R will perform:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
